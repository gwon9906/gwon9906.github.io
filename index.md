# AI/ML Engineering Student

I pursue both efficiency and practicality in AI models.  
By understanding hardware constraints and analyzing data characteristics,  
I design and implement optimized AI solutions.

As an undergraduate researcher in Computer Engineering, I focus on building practical AI systems that work in resource-constrained environments. My experience spans from IoT communication optimization to industrial AI applications, with a strong emphasis on model compression and system-level optimization.
